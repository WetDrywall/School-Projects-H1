API Postal Code is a project about searching for specific data from a API, where we in this case look for postal codes and the name of citys in Denmark.

Type Ahead is very similar to API Postal Code, and was our introduction to API, the differences are the API we used and the design, but otherwise are they very similar.

Apptimer is a website we build as a countdown timer, it comes with 5 default timer options and one where you can write your own amount of minuts that you want a timer for.
And when you input how much it should countdown from it will tell you when to be back.
